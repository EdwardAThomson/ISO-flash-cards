# E1: Scope & Definitions

## What the Act Covers

The EU AI Act applies to the **placing on the market, putting into service, and use of AI systems** within the European Union. It has extraterritorial reach, meaning it can apply to organizations outside the EU if their AI systems affect people within the EU.

## Key Definitions

### AI System
An AI system is defined as:
> A machine-based system designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy and that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment, and that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers from the input it receives how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments.

### Key Actors

| Role | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Provider** | Develops an AI system or has one developed, and places it on the market or puts it into service under their own name or trademark |
| **Deployer** | Uses an AI system under their authority (except for personal, non-professional use) |
| **Importer** | Places an AI system from a third country on the EU market |
| **Distributor** | Makes an AI system available on the EU market (not provider or importer) |
| **Authorized Representative** | Located in the EU, appointed by a provider to act on their behalf |

## Territorial Scope

The Act applies to:

1. **Providers** placing AI systems on the EU market or putting them into service, regardless of location
2. **Deployers** located within the EU
3. **Providers and deployers** located outside the EU, where the AI system's **output is used in the EU**
4. **Importers and distributors** of AI systems
5. **Product manufacturers** placing AI systems on the market together with their product

## What's Excluded

The Act does **not** apply to:

- AI systems used exclusively for **military, defense, or national security** purposes
- AI systems used by **public authorities in third countries** (for international cooperation)
- AI systems developed for **scientific research and development** only
- **Personal, non-professional** use of AI systems
- AI systems released under **free and open-source licenses** (with exceptions for high-risk and prohibited AI)

## Important Concepts

### Placing on the Market
The first making available of an AI system on the EU market — applies to new systems only.

### Putting into Service
The supply of an AI system for first use directly to the deployer or for own use.

### Intended Purpose
The use for which an AI system is intended by the provider, including the specific context and conditions of use as specified in documentation, instructions, and marketing materials.

### Reasonably Foreseeable Misuse
Use of an AI system in a way not intended by the provider but which may result from reasonably foreseeable human behavior or interaction with other systems.

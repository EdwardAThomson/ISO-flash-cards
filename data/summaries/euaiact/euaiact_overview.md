# EU AI Act Overview

The **EU AI Act** (Artificial Intelligence Act) is the world's first comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence. It was adopted by the European Parliament in March 2024 and establishes rules for AI systems based on their risk level.

## Key Objectives

- **Protect fundamental rights** — Ensure AI systems respect human dignity, privacy, and non-discrimination
- **Promote trustworthy AI** — Establish requirements for transparency, accountability, and human oversight
- **Foster innovation** — Create legal certainty while supporting AI development in Europe
- **Harmonize rules** — Establish a single market for AI across EU member states

## Risk-Based Approach

The Act classifies AI systems into four risk categories:

| Risk Level | Description | Examples |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Unacceptable** | Banned outright | Social scoring, manipulative AI, real-time biometric surveillance |
| **High-Risk** | Strict requirements | Employment decisions, credit scoring, critical infrastructure |
| **Limited Risk** | Transparency obligations | Chatbots, emotion recognition, deepfakes |
| **Minimal Risk** | No specific requirements | Spam filters, AI in video games |

## Who Does It Apply To?

The Act applies to:

- **Providers** — Organizations that develop or place AI systems on the EU market
- **Deployers** — Organizations that use AI systems in their operations
- **Importers & Distributors** — Entities bringing AI systems into the EU
- **Third-country operators** — Non-EU entities whose AI systems affect EU citizens

## Timeline

- **August 2024** — Act enters into force
- **February 2025** — Prohibited AI practices banned
- **August 2025** — GPAI model rules apply
- **August 2026** — Full application of high-risk AI requirements

## Key Requirements for High-Risk AI

High-risk AI systems must meet these requirements:

1. **Risk management system** — Identify and mitigate risks throughout the lifecycle
2. **Data governance** — Use high-quality, representative training data
3. **Technical documentation** — Maintain detailed records of system design
4. **Record-keeping** — Enable traceability through logging
5. **Transparency** — Provide clear information to users
6. **Human oversight** — Allow meaningful human control
7. **Accuracy & robustness** — Ensure reliable performance

## Penalties

Non-compliance can result in significant fines:

- Up to **€35 million** or **7% of global turnover** for prohibited AI practices
- Up to **€15 million** or **3% of global turnover** for other violations
- Up to **€7.5 million** or **1.5% of global turnover** for incorrect information

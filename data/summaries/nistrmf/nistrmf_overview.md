# NIST AI Risk Management Framework Overview

The **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)** is a voluntary framework published by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology in January 2023. It provides guidance for managing risks associated with AI systems throughout their lifecycle.

## Purpose

The AI RMF helps organizations:
- **Design, develop, deploy, and use** AI systems responsibly
- **Identify and manage** AI-related risks
- **Build trustworthy AI** that is valid, reliable, safe, and fair
- **Establish governance** structures for AI oversight

## Key Characteristics

Unlike regulatory frameworks, the NIST AI RMF is:
- **Voluntary** — Not legally mandated
- **Flexible** — Adaptable to different contexts and use cases
- **Risk-based** — Proportional to the level of risk
- **Lifecycle-oriented** — Applies throughout AI system development and use

## Framework Structure

The AI RMF consists of two main parts:

### Part 1: Foundational Information
- Framing risk in AI systems
- Intended audience
- Understanding and addressing AI risks
- Characteristics of trustworthy AI

### Part 2: Core Functions
Four functions that form a continuous cycle:

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **GOVERN** | Establish culture, policies, and accountability for AI risk management |
| **MAP** | Understand context, identify risks, and characterize AI systems |
| **MEASURE** | Assess, analyze, and track identified risks |
| **MANAGE** | Prioritize, respond to, and monitor risks |

## Trustworthy AI Characteristics

The framework identifies seven characteristics of trustworthy AI:

1. **Valid & Reliable** — Performs as intended with consistent results
2. **Safe** — Does not endanger human life, health, property, or environment
3. **Secure & Resilient** — Maintains confidentiality, integrity, and availability
4. **Accountable & Transparent** — Clear responsibility and explainable decisions
5. **Explainable & Interpretable** — Understandable by users and stakeholders
6. **Privacy-Enhanced** — Protects personal and sensitive information
7. **Fair with Harmful Bias Managed** — Equitable treatment, bias mitigated

## Who Should Use It?

The framework is designed for:
- **AI developers and engineers**
- **Risk managers and compliance teams**
- **Executives and decision-makers**
- **Procurement and acquisition professionals**
- **End users and affected communities**

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

| Framework | Relationship |
|-----------|--------------|
| **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** | Complementary; AI RMF addresses AI-specific risks |
| **NIST Privacy Framework** | Complementary; AI RMF incorporates privacy considerations |
| **ISO/IEC 42001** | Aligned; both address AI management systems |
| **EU AI Act** | AI RMF can support compliance with regulatory requirements |

## Implementation Approach

The framework recommends:

1. **Start with governance** — Establish leadership commitment and accountability
2. **Map your context** — Understand where and how AI is used
3. **Measure risks** — Assess potential impacts and likelihood
4. **Manage continuously** — Implement controls and monitor effectiveness
5. **Iterate** — Revisit and improve as systems and contexts evolve

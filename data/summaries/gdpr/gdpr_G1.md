# G1: Lawful Bases & Principles

## Lawfulness of Processing

Processing personal data must have at least **one valid legal basis** under Article 6 GDPR.

### Main Legal Bases (Article 6)

| Legal Basis | When It Applies | Notes |
|------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Consent** | Individual gives **freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous** agreement | Must be as easy to withdraw as to give |
| **Contract** | Processing is **necessary for a contract** with the individual or to take steps at their request | E.g., processing address to deliver goods |
| **Legal obligation** | Required to comply with **EU or Member State law** | E.g., tax or accounting requirements |
| **Vital interests** | Necessary to **protect someone’s life** | Typically emergencies, healthcare |
| **Public task** | Necessary for a task in the **public interest** or exercise of official authority | Often public sector |
| **Legitimate interests** | Necessary for **legitimate interests** of controller or third party, unless overridden by interests/rights of the individual | Requires balancing test |

### Choosing a Legal Basis

- Must be decided **before** processing starts
- Must be **documented** and explained in privacy notices
- Cannot be easily swapped later (especially consent ↔ legitimate interests)

### Legitimate Interests

When relying on legitimate interests:
1. **Purpose test** — Is there a legitimate purpose?
2. **Necessity test** — Is processing necessary to achieve it?
3. **Balancing test** — Do the individual’s rights override the interest?

Document this (often in a Legitimate Interests Assessment, LIA).

## Consent

### Requirements for Valid Consent

Consent must be:
- **Freely given** — no coercion or bundling with unrelated services
- **Specific** — for clearly defined purposes
- **Informed** — clear information provided beforehand
- **Unambiguous** — clear affirmative action (no pre‑ticked boxes)
- **Documented** — evidence of when/how consent was given

### Withdrawal of Consent

- Must be **as easy to withdraw as to give**
- Individuals must be **informed** of their right to withdraw
- Withdrawal does **not affect past lawful processing**, but you must stop going forward (unless another legal basis applies)

## Principles of Processing (Article 5)

Remember the **seven key principles** (often memorized as *"L‑P‑D‑A‑S‑I‑A"*):

1. **Lawfulness, fairness, transparency**
2. **Purpose limitation**
3. **Data minimization**
4. **Accuracy**
5. **Storage limitation**
6. **Integrity and confidentiality**
7. **Accountability**

### 1. Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency

- **Lawfulness** — Have a valid legal basis
- **Fairness** — Don’t use data in ways that are unexpected, misleading, or deceptive
- **Transparency** — Provide clear, accessible privacy information

### 2. Purpose Limitation

- Specify purposes at collection time
- Avoid using data for incompatible new purposes without a new basis

### 3. Data Minimization

- Collect only what is **necessary**
- Avoid “nice to have” data without a clear purpose

### 4. Accuracy

- Keep data accurate and up to date
- Provide mechanisms for correction

### 5. Storage Limitation

- Define retention periods
- Delete or anonymize data when no longer needed

### 6. Integrity and Confidentiality

- Implement appropriate security (technical and organizational measures)
- Protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage

### 7. Accountability

- Be able to **demonstrate** compliance (not just claim it)
- Maintain records, DPIAs, policies, training, monitoring, etc.

## Practical Checklist

When designing a processing activity:

- **Define purposes** clearly
- **Choose a legal basis** and document it
- **Apply principles** (minimization, storage limits, etc.)
- **Draft transparency information** (privacy notice)
- **Plan rights handling** (access, deletion, objection)
- **Assess risks** and security measures

## Key Takeaways

1. Every processing operation must have **one or more legal bases**.
2. **Consent** is only valid if it meets strict conditions.
3. **Legitimate interests** require a documented balancing test.
4. The **principles of processing** are the backbone of GDPR.
5. **Accountability** turns principles into operational requirements.

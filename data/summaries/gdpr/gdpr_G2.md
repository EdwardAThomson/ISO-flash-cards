# G2: Data Subject Rights

## Overview of Rights

GDPR grants individuals (data subjects) a set of rights over their personal data. Controllers must have processes to **enable, respond to, and document** these rights.

In most cases, the controller must respond **without undue delay** and within **one month**, with extensions allowed for complex requests.

## Right to Be Informed (Articles 12–14)

Individuals have the right to be informed about:
- Who is processing their data (controller identity and contact details)
- Purposes and legal bases
- Categories of personal data
- Recipients or categories of recipients
- Retention periods
- Rights (access, rectification, erasure, etc.)
- Whether data will be transferred outside the EU/EEA
- Existence of automated decision‑making and its logic/impact

This is typically implemented via **privacy notices** or **privacy policies**.

### Key Requirements

- Information must be **concise, transparent, intelligible, easily accessible**
- Use **clear and plain language**, especially for children
- Provide information **at the time of collection** (or within defined timeframes if obtained from other sources)

---

## Right of Access (Article 15)

Individuals can obtain:
- Confirmation whether you process their personal data
- A copy of their personal data
- Additional information (similar to what’s in the privacy notice)

### Implementation Points

- Verify identity before disclosing data
- Provide data in a **commonly used format**
- Avoid including other people’s data unless you have consent or another basis (may need redaction)

---

## Right to Rectification (Article 16)

Individuals can have **inaccurate or incomplete data corrected**.

- Correct inaccurate information
- Complete incomplete data (possibly via a supplementary statement)
- Inform recipients where appropriate

---

## Right to Erasure ("Right to Be Forgotten", Article 17)

Individuals can request deletion of their data in certain cases, e.g.:
- Data no longer necessary for the purposes collected
- Consent withdrawn and no other legal basis
- Successful objection to processing
- Unlawful processing
- Legal obligation to erase

### Limitations

Erasure may not apply when processing is necessary for:
- Freedom of expression and information
- Legal obligations
- Public interest in public health
- Archiving in the public interest, research or statistics (under safeguards)
- Establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims

---

## Right to Restriction of Processing (Article 18)

Individuals can request that processing be **limited**, e.g. when:
- Accuracy of data is contested (while you verify)
- Processing is unlawful but individual prefers restriction over erasure
- Data is no longer needed for your purposes, but required for legal claims
- Individual has objected and verification is pending

During restriction, you may generally **store** the data but not otherwise process it, except in limited circumstances.

---

## Right to Data Portability (Article 20)

Applies when processing is:
- Based on **consent** or **contract**, and
- Carried out by **automated means**

Individuals can receive their personal data in a **structured, commonly used, machine‑readable format** and have it transmitted to another controller **where technically feasible**.

---

## Right to Object (Article 21)

Individuals can object to processing that is based on:
- **Legitimate interests**
- **Public task**

If they object:
- You must **stop processing** unless you demonstrate **compelling legitimate grounds** that override the interests/rights of the individual, or for legal claims.

### Special Case: Direct Marketing

- Individuals can **object at any time** to processing for direct marketing (including profiling for marketing).
- If they object, you must **stop marketing** to them.

---

## Rights Regarding Automated Decision‑Making (Article 22)

Individuals have the right **not to be subject** to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces **legal effects** or similarly significantly affects them.

Exceptions exist (e.g., necessary for contract, authorized by law, or based on explicit consent), but in such cases, organizations must implement **safeguards**, such as:
- Human intervention
- Ability to express a point of view
- Ability to contest the decision

---

## Handling Rights Requests

### Operational Considerations

- **Intake channels** — How can individuals submit requests? (web form, email, postal)
- **Verification** — How do you verify identity?
- **Triage** — What type of right is being exercised?
- **Deadlines** — Track 1‑month timeline and any extensions
- **Logging** — Record requests, actions taken, and outcomes
- **Cross‑system search** — Locate data across systems
- **Standard responses** — Templates for common scenarios

---

## Key Takeaways

1. GDPR gives individuals **strong rights** over their data.
2. Controllers must have **repeatable processes** for handling requests.
3. Most responses are due within **one month**.
4. Certain rights have **conditions and limitations**, especially erasure and portability.
5. Automated decision‑making and profiling require **special care and safeguards**.

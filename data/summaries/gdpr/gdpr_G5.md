# G5: Security & Data Breach Notification

## Security of Processing (Article 32)

Controllers and processors must implement **appropriate technical and organizational measures** to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.

### Factors to Consider

- State of the art
- Implementation costs
- Nature, scope, context and purposes of processing
- Risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms

### Example Measures

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Technical** | Encryption, pseudonymization, access control, logging, backups |
| **Organizational** | Policies, training, segregation of duties, incident response |
| **Physical** | Secure areas, entry controls, environmental protection |

GDPR is **risk‑based**: higher risk requires stronger measures.

## Data Breach Definition (Article 4(12))

A **personal data breach** is a breach of security leading to:
- **Accidental or unlawful destruction** of personal data
- **Loss or alteration** of personal data
- **Unauthorized disclosure of or access** to personal data

This includes confidentiality, integrity, and availability incidents.

---

## Breach Notification to Supervisory Authority (Article 33)

Controllers must notify the competent supervisory authority **without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours** after becoming aware of a personal data breach, **unless** the breach is **unlikely to result in a risk** to rights and freedoms.

### Notification Must Include (Where Possible)

- Nature of the breach (including categories and approximate number of data subjects and records)
- DPO or contact point details
- Likely consequences of the breach
- Measures taken or proposed to address the breach and mitigate adverse effects

If not all information is available immediately, it can be provided in phases.

Processors must **notify controllers** without undue delay after becoming aware of a breach.

---

## Communication to Data Subjects (Article 34)

If the breach is **likely to result in a high risk** to individuals’ rights and freedoms, the controller must **communicate the breach to data subjects without undue delay**.

### Communication Requirements

- In clear and plain language
- Describe the nature of the breach
- Provide contact details
- Explain likely consequences
- Explain measures taken or proposed

### When Communication May Not Be Required

- Data was protected by appropriate technical and organizational measures (e.g., strong encryption)
- Subsequent measures ensure high risk is no longer likely to materialize
- It would involve disproportionate effort (in which case a public communication may be used instead)

## Breach Management Process

### Typical Steps

1. **Detect** — Identify possible incident or breach
2. **Triage** — Assess whether personal data is involved
3. **Contain** — Limit scope and impact
4. **Assess risk** — Evaluate risk to individuals
5. **Decide notifications** — Supervisory authority, data subjects, others
6. **Remediate** — Fix root causes and vulnerabilities
7. **Document** — Record breach, decisions, and actions
8. **Learn** — Improve controls and processes

### Breach Register

Controllers should maintain a **breach register** documenting:
- Facts relating to the breach
- Its effects
- Remedial action taken

This supports accountability and helps with supervisory authority oversight.

## Security Controls and Frameworks

While GDPR does not mandate specific frameworks, it aligns well with:
- **ISO/IEC 27001** — Information Security Management Systems
- **ISO/IEC 27002** — Security controls
- **ISO/IEC 27701** — Privacy information management
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**

Using such frameworks can help demonstrate **appropriate security measures**.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. GDPR expects **risk‑based security** appropriate to threats and impacts.
2. Not all incidents are breaches, and not all breaches require notification, but **all must be assessed and logged**.
3. 72 hours is a **tight deadline** — preparation and clear procedures are essential.
4. High‑risk breaches typically require **communication to individuals**.
5. Breach management is both a **security** and **privacy** responsibility.

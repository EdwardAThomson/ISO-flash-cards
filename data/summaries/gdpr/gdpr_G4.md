# G4: Records, Accountability & Governance

## Accountability (Article 5(2))

The **accountability principle** requires that controllers:
- **Comply** with the GDPR principles, and
- Are able to **demonstrate** that compliance.

This shifts GDPR from a “tick‑box” law to an **evidence‑driven** framework. Governance structures, documentation, and monitoring are key.

## Governance Framework

### Typical Governance Elements

| Element | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| **Policies** | Data protection, information security, retention |
| **Procedures** | Rights handling, incident response, DPIA process |
| **Roles** | DPO, privacy champions, system owners |
| **Registers** | RoPA, data breach log, DPIA log |
| **Training** | Regular privacy awareness, role‑based training |
| **Monitoring** | Audits, KPIs, metrics, controls testing |

### Lines of Defense Model

1. **First line** — Business and IT owners (own and manage risks)
2. **Second line** — Privacy/compliance and risk functions (oversee)
3. **Third line** — Internal audit (independent assurance)

---

## Records of Processing (RoPA)

As covered in G3, RoPA under Article 30 is a **core accountability tool**.

Additional good practices:
- Link RoPA entries to DPIAs where applicable
- Record legal bases and data subject rights
- Include retention periods and security measures

---

## Policies and Procedures

### Policy Stack

- **Corporate privacy policy** — high‑level commitments
- **Internal data protection policy** — detailed expectations for staff
- **Topic policies** — e.g., retention, data subject rights, data sharing

### Procedures

- **Rights request handling** — intake, verification, triage, response
- **Data breach response** — detection, assessment, notification
- **Vendor onboarding** — DPIA triggers, DPA templates, security reviews
- **Change management** — privacy review for new projects (data protection by design)

---

## Training and Awareness

Effective GDPR compliance requires:
- **Onboarding training** for all staff
- **Regular refreshers** (e.g., annually)
- **Targeted training** for high‑risk roles (HR, marketing, engineering, product)
- **Awareness campaigns** (posters, intranet, phishing simulations)

Track **completion rates** and effectiveness as part of accountability.

---

## Monitoring, Audits and Metrics

### Monitoring Activities

- Periodic reviews of RoPA and DPIAs
- Sampling of records for retention compliance
- Checks on vendor contracts and DPAs
- Spot checks on privacy notices and consent flows

### Internal Audits

- Planned audits against GDPR requirements and internal policies
- Findings lead to **corrective actions** and improvements

### Metrics (Example)

| Area | Example Metrics |
|------|-----------------|
| **RoPA** | % of processing activities documented |
| **DPIAs** | Number completed, number with high residual risks |
| **Rights** | Volume and timeliness of responses |
| **Incidents** | Count, severity, response times |
| **Training** | Completion rates, quiz scores |

---

## Vendor & Third‑Party Governance

GDPR expects controllers to manage **third‑party risk**:
- Maintain a **register of processors** and key vendors
- Standardize **due diligence** (security/privacy questionnaires)
- Use **standard DPA templates** with required clauses
- Periodically **review** vendors (security reports, certifications, audits)

---

## Documentation & Evidence

Examples of documentation that support accountability:
- Policies, procedures, standards
- Records of processing activities
- DPIAs and risk assessments
- Training materials and attendance records
- Incident reports and breach logs
- Vendor due‑diligence records and DPAs
- Technical documentation (security measures)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Accountability = show your work** — not just obey the rules.
2. Governance requires **roles, policies, and processes**.
3. **Records, DPIAs, training, and monitoring** are central evidence.
4. Third‑party management is part of GDPR compliance.
5. Metrics and audits support **continuous improvement**.

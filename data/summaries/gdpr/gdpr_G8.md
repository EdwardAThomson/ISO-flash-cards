# G8: Enforcement, Fines & Supervisory Authorities

## Supervisory Authorities (SAs)

Each EU/EEA Member State has an independent **supervisory authority** responsible for monitoring application of the GDPR.

### Roles and Powers

- Monitor and enforce GDPR
- Promote awareness and understanding
- Advise national institutions
- Handle complaints
- Conduct investigations and audits
- Issue warnings, reprimands, and orders
- Impose administrative fines

### One‑Stop‑Shop Mechanism

For cross‑border processing, a **lead supervisory authority** coordinates with other concerned SAs via the **cooperation and consistency** mechanisms.

## European Data Protection Board (EDPB)

The EDPB ensures consistent application of GDPR across the EU/EEA.

- Issues guidelines, recommendations, and best practices
- Resolves disputes between supervisory authorities
- Provides opinions on draft decisions and adequacy decisions

EDPB guidance is key for understanding regulatory expectations.

## Administrative Fines (Article 83)

GDPR allows for **significant fines**, but they must be **effective, proportionate, and dissuasive**.

### Two Main Tiers

1. Up to **10 million EUR** or **2%** of total worldwide annual turnover (whichever is higher) — for certain infringements (e.g., security obligations, processor contracts, records, breach notifications).
2. Up to **20 million EUR** or **4%** of total worldwide annual turnover — for more serious infringements (e.g., basic principles, rights, international transfers, orders of SAs).

### Factors Considered

When deciding whether to impose a fine and its amount, SAs consider, among other things:
- Nature, gravity and duration of infringement
- Intentional or negligent character
- Actions to mitigate damage
- Degree of responsibility (technical and organizational measures)
- Previous infringements
- Cooperation with the authority
- Categories of personal data affected
- How the infringement became known
- Compliance with measures previously ordered

## Remedies for Individuals

Individuals have the right to:
- Lodge a **complaint** with an SA
- Seek **judicial remedy** against a controller/processor
- Receive **compensation** for material or non‑material damage resulting from a GDPR infringement

Controllers and processors can be jointly liable, subject to rights of recourse.

---

## Codes of Conduct and Certification

### Codes of Conduct (Article 40)

- Developed by associations or bodies representing categories of controllers/processors
- Approved by SAs and possibly the Commission
- Help demonstrate compliance and support consistent application

### Certification (Article 42)

- Voluntary mechanisms (e.g., certification schemes, seals, marks)
- Help demonstrate compliance with certain aspects of GDPR
- Do **not** reduce responsibility of controllers/processors, but can be positive in enforcement assessments

---

## Trends in Enforcement

Supervisory authorities increasingly focus on:
- Transparency and lawful bases
- Behavioral advertising and online tracking
- International transfers and Schrems II compliance
- Security failures leading to large breaches
- Unlawful profiling and automated decision‑making

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Supervisory authorities have **broad investigative and corrective powers**.
2. Fines can reach **20M EUR or 4%** of global turnover, but are risk‑ and behavior‑based.
3. Cooperation, mitigation, and demonstrated accountability can **influence enforcement outcomes**.
4. Individuals have robust **rights to complain, litigate, and seek compensation**.
5. Codes of conduct and certification can help demonstrate compliance but do not replace it.

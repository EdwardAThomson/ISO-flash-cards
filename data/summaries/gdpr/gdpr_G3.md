# G3: Controllers, Processors & DPIAs

## Controllers and Processors

### Controller

A **controller** determines the **purposes and means** of processing personal data.

Examples:
- An online retailer deciding how to collect and use customer data
- An employer deciding how to manage employee data

### Joint Controllers

Two or more controllers **jointly determine** purposes and means.

- Must define their respective responsibilities in a **joint controller arrangement**
- Key information must be made available to data subjects

### Processor

A **processor** processes personal data on behalf of a controller, following its instructions.

Examples:
- Cloud hosting provider
- Payroll service provider
- Email delivery platform

Processors now have **direct obligations** under GDPR (e.g. security, breach notification to controller, maintaining records, etc.).

## Data Processing Agreements (DPAs, Article 28)

Whenever a controller uses a processor, there must be a **contract** (or other legal act) that:

- Is **binding** on the processor
- Sets out **subject‑matter and duration** of processing
- Defines **nature and purpose**, **type of personal data**, and **categories of data subjects**

### Minimum Requirements

The contract must require the processor to:
- Only process data on documented instructions from the controller
- Ensure confidentiality of persons authorized to process data
- Take appropriate technical and organizational security measures
- Obtain controller authorization for sub‑processors and flow down obligations
- Assist controller with rights requests and DPIAs where appropriate
- Assist with security obligations and breach notifications
- Delete or return all data at end of services
- Make information available to demonstrate compliance and allow audits

## Records of Processing Activities (RoPA, Article 30)

Controllers (and in some cases processors) must maintain **records of processing activities**, typically including:

For controllers:
- Name and contact details of controller (and DPO if any)
- Purposes of processing
- Categories of data subjects and personal data
- Categories of recipients
- Transfers to third countries/international organizations and safeguards
- Retention periods
- General description of security measures (can be referenced)

For processors, similar records relating to processing on behalf of controllers.

Exemptions apply for some small organizations, but many still maintain records as a **good practice**.

## Data Protection by Design and by Default (Article 25)

Controllers must implement **data protection by design and by default**.

### Data Protection by Design

Integrate data protection into:
- System design and architecture
- Business processes
- Product and service development

Examples:
- Minimizing data collected
- Pseudonymization
- Access controls
- Security testing in development

### Data Protection by Default

Ensure that, by default:
- Only necessary data is processed
- Data is not made accessible to an indefinite number of people
- Privacy‑preserving settings are standard (e.g., opt‑in instead of opt‑out)

---

## Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs, Article 35)

A **DPIA** is a structured assessment of **high‑risk processing** to individuals’ rights and freedoms.

### When DPIAs Are Required

DPIAs are required particularly when processing involves:
- Systematic and extensive profiling with significant effects
- Large‑scale processing of special categories of data
- Large‑scale monitoring of publicly accessible areas

Supervisory authorities may publish lists of processing **requiring** or **exempt from** DPIAs.

### DPIA Contents

Typically include:
- Description of processing and purposes
- Assessment of necessity and proportionality
- Assessment of risks to rights and freedoms
- Measures to address risks and demonstrate compliance

### DPIA Outcomes

- Proceed with processing (with controls)
- Modify design to reduce risks
- In some cases, **consult supervisory authority** if high risk remains that cannot be mitigated

---

## Data Protection Officer (DPO, Articles 37–39)

Some organizations must appoint a **DPO**, e.g. when:
- Processing is carried out by a public authority (with some exceptions)
- Core activities involve regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects **on a large scale**
- Core activities involve large‑scale processing of special categories or criminal data

### DPO Role

- Informs and advises on obligations
- Monitors compliance
- Provides advice on DPIAs
- Cooperates with supervisory authorities
- Acts as contact point

The DPO must be able to perform their tasks **independently**, with no conflict of interest.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Controllers decide**, processors **act on instructions**.
2. DPAs are **mandatory** when using processors and must contain specific clauses.
3. **Records of processing** support accountability and oversight.
4. **Data protection by design and default** embeds privacy into systems.
5. **DPIAs** are essential for high‑risk processing.
6. A **DPO** is required in certain cases and plays a central advisory role.

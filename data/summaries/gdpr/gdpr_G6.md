# G6: International Transfers

## What Is an International Transfer?

An **international transfer** occurs when personal data is sent or made accessible to a **third country** (outside the EU/EEA) or an **international organization**, or when an entity in such a country accesses data stored in the EU.

Transfers must comply with **Chapter V** of the GDPR.

## Main Transfer Mechanisms

### 1. Adequacy Decisions (Article 45)

The European Commission may decide that a country, territory, sector, or international organization ensures an **adequate level of protection**.

If an adequacy decision exists:
- Transfers can occur without additional specific authorization
- Still need a legal basis and general GDPR compliance

Examples (subject to change):
- Countries like Japan, UK (post‑Brexit, with adequacy), etc.

### 2. Appropriate Safeguards (Article 46)

In the absence of an adequacy decision, controllers/processors can use **appropriate safeguards**, such as:

- **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** adopted by the Commission
- **Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)** for intra‑group transfers
- Approved codes of conduct + binding commitments
- Approved certification mechanisms + binding commitments
- Contractual clauses authorized by a supervisory authority

These safeguards must be **enforceable** and provide **effective remedies** for individuals.

### 3. Derogations (Article 49)

For **occasional and specific** transfers, derogations may apply, e.g.:
- Explicit consent
- Necessary for contract with the individual
- Important reasons of public interest
- Establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims
- Protection of vital interests where individual cannot consent

Derogations are **exceptions**, not a primary strategy.

## Schrems II and Transfer Risk Assessments

The **Schrems II** judgment (CJEU, 2020) invalidated the EU–US Privacy Shield and emphasized:

- Controllers using SCCs must assess **whether the law and practice** of the destination country ensure protection essentially equivalent to the EU.
- If not, they must implement **supplementary measures** or suspend transfers.

This led to the concept of **Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs)** or similar analyses.

### Supplementary Measures

Can be:
- **Technical** — strong encryption with keys retained in the EU; pseudonymization where re‑identification is only possible in the EU
- **Contractual** — additional clauses and commitments
- **Organizational** — internal policies, transparency, training

Technical measures are often the most effective in limiting access by foreign authorities.

## Practical Steps for Organizations

1. **Map transfers** — Know where personal data is stored and accessed, including cloud services and support access.
2. **Identify transfer tools** — Adequacy, SCCs, BCRs, etc.
3. **Assess destination laws and risks** — Especially for SCCs/BCRs.
4. **Apply supplementary measures** where needed.
5. **Update contracts and documentation** — SCCs, policies, records.
6. **Monitor legal developments** — Adequacy decisions, guidance, case law.

## Documentation and Transparency

- Record transfer mechanisms in **RoPA** and **privacy notices**.
- Inform individuals about **international transfers** and safeguards.
- Maintain **copies of SCCs/BCRs** and related assessments.

## Key Takeaways

1. International transfers are **tightly regulated** under GDPR.
2. **Adequacy** is simplest; **SCCs/BCRs** require additional analysis.
3. Schrems II introduced **transfer risk assessments** and supplementary measures.
4. Derogations are for **exceptional situations**, not routine transfers.
5. Documentation and transparency are essential for accountability.

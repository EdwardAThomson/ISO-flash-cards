# GDPR Overview

## What is the GDPR?

The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** is the EU’s comprehensive data protection law. It governs how organizations collect, use, share, and protect personal data of individuals in the EU/EEA, and in many cases applies extraterritorially.

## Key Facts

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Full title** | Regulation (EU) 2016/679 — General Data Protection Regulation |
| **Type** | EU regulation (directly applicable law) |
| **Scope** | Processing of personal data of **natural persons** in the EU/EEA |
| **Territorial reach** | Applies to controllers/processors inside the EU, and many outside if they target or monitor people in the EU |
| **Enforcement** | Independent supervisory authorities + European Data Protection Board (EDPB) |

## Core Goals

GDPR aims to:
- **Protect fundamental rights and freedoms** of natural persons, especially privacy
- **Harmonize** data protection laws across EU/EEA
- **Increase transparency** and control for individuals
- **Promote accountability** for organizations processing personal data

## Key Concepts

### Personal Data
Any information relating to an **identified or identifiable natural person** (data subject).

Examples:
- Obvious: name, email, phone number, ID number
- Less obvious: IP address, cookie IDs, device IDs, location data, online identifiers

### Special Categories of Data
Particularly sensitive data that usually require **stricter protections** and a specific legal basis, e.g.:
- Health data
- Biometric data for unique identification
- Racial or ethnic origin
- Political opinions
- Religious or philosophical beliefs
- Trade union membership
- Sexual orientation or sex life

### Processing
Any operation performed on personal data, such as:
- Collection, recording, storage
- Adaptation, retrieval, consultation
- Use, disclosure, transfer
- Restriction, erasure, destruction

### Controller vs Processor

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Controller** | Decides **why** and **how** personal data is processed |
| **Processor** | Processes data **on behalf of** the controller, following instructions |

Controllers have primary responsibility for compliance. Processors have direct obligations too.

## Principles of Processing

GDPR is built on **seven key principles** (Article 5):

1. **Lawfulness, fairness, transparency**  
   Processing must have a legal basis, be fair, and clear to individuals.

2. **Purpose limitation**  
   Collect data for **specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes**, and don’t process it in ways incompatible with those purposes.

3. **Data minimization**  
   Process **only** the data that is **adequate, relevant, and limited** to what is necessary.

4. **Accuracy**  
   Keep data **accurate** and **up to date**; correct or delete inaccurate data.

5. **Storage limitation**  
   Keep data **no longer than necessary** for the purposes; define retention periods.

6. **Integrity and confidentiality**  
   Protect data with appropriate **security** (technical and organizational measures).

7. **Accountability**  
   The controller is **responsible for** and must be able to **demonstrate** compliance with all principles.

These principles show up everywhere in GDPR and are a good mental checklist.

## Territorial Scope (Article 3)

GDPR applies when:

- **Establishment in the EU**: A controller or processor has an establishment in the EU and processes personal data **in the context of that establishment**; or
- **Targeting/monitoring people in the EU**: A non‑EU controller/processor offers goods or services to people in the EU, or **monitors their behavior** (e.g., tracking for profiling).

This means many non‑EU companies can still be subject to GDPR.

---

## Legal Bases Overview

Processing personal data must have at least **one legal basis** (Article 6), such as:
- Consent
- Contract
- Legal obligation
- Vital interests
- Public task
- Legitimate interests

Special‑category data usually needs:
- A **specific Article 9 condition** (e.g., explicit consent, employment law, public health), **plus**
- A general Article 6 legal basis.

(We’ll break these down in more detail in the dedicated sections.)

## Data Subject Rights Overview

GDPR gives individuals several rights, including:
- Right to be informed (transparency notices)
- Right of access
- Right to rectification
- Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")
- Right to restriction of processing
- Right to data portability
- Right to object
- Rights related to automated decision‑making and profiling

Organizations need **processes** to handle rights requests within deadlines (usually 1 month).

---

## Accountability & Governance Themes

Key accountability mechanisms include:
- Records of processing activities (RoPA)
- Data protection impact assessments (DPIAs)
- Data protection by design and by default
- Data processing agreements (DPAs) with processors
- Data breach notification processes
- Data protection officer (DPO) where required

---

## Enforcement & Fines (High Level)

- Supervisory authorities can investigate, order changes, and impose fines.
- Administrative fines can reach **up to 20 million EUR or 4%** of total worldwide annual turnover (whichever is higher), depending on the infringement.
- Factors considered include nature, gravity, duration, intent, mitigation, and cooperation.

## Key Takeaways

1. **GDPR is principle‑ and risk‑based** — focus on fundamental rights, not just checklists.
2. **Personal data is broad** — includes online identifiers and indirect identifiers.
3. **Accountability is central** — you must be able to demonstrate compliance.
4. **Territorial scope is wide** — non‑EU organizations can still fall under GDPR.
5. **Rights and transparency** — individuals must understand and control how their data is used.

# Context & Scope

## Understanding the Organization (Clause 4)

Before building an ISMS, organizations must understand their **context** — the internal and external factors that affect information security.

## External Context (Clause 4.1)

### External Issues to Consider

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Legal/Regulatory** | GDPR, industry regulations, contractual obligations |
| **Threat landscape** | Cyber threats, attack trends, threat actors |
| **Technology** | Cloud adoption, remote work, emerging tech |
| **Market** | Customer expectations, competitive pressures |
| **Economic** | Budget constraints, economic conditions |
| **Social** | Public perception, workforce trends |

### Sources of External Information

- Threat intelligence feeds
- Industry reports and benchmarks
- Regulatory updates
- Customer requirements
- Vendor security assessments

## Internal Context (Clause 4.1)

### Internal Issues to Consider

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Governance** | Organizational structure, decision-making |
| **Culture** | Security awareness, risk appetite |
| **Capabilities** | Skills, resources, technology |
| **Strategy** | Business objectives, digital transformation |
| **Processes** | Existing procedures, change management |
| **Systems** | IT infrastructure, applications, data flows |

---

## Interested Parties (Clause 4.2)

Organizations must identify **stakeholders** and their requirements.

### Common Interested Parties

| Stakeholder | Typical Requirements |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Customers** | Data protection, service availability, breach notification |
| **Regulators** | Compliance, reporting, audit access |
| **Employees** | Privacy, clear policies, training |
| **Shareholders** | Risk management, reputation protection |
| **Suppliers** | Clear requirements, fair contracts |
| **Partners** | Secure data exchange, trust |

### Determining Requirements

For each interested party:
1. **Identify** who they are
2. **Determine** their requirements
3. **Assess** which are relevant to the ISMS
4. **Document** applicable requirements
5. **Review** periodically for changes

## Scope of the ISMS (Clause 4.3)

### Defining Scope

The scope defines the **boundaries** of the ISMS — what's included and what's not.

### Scope Considerations

| Factor | Questions |
|--------|-----------|
| **External issues** | What external factors affect scope? |
| **Internal issues** | What internal factors affect scope? |
| **Requirements** | What must be included to meet stakeholder needs? |
| **Interfaces** | What are the dependencies with external parties? |

### Scope Dimensions

| Dimension | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| **Organizational** | Departments, business units, subsidiaries |
| **Geographic** | Locations, data centers, remote workers |
| **Technical** | Systems, networks, applications, data |
| **Process** | Business processes, services |

### Scope Statement

A clear scope statement should include:
- Organizational units covered
- Locations included
- Information systems in scope
- Business processes covered
- Exclusions with justification

### Example Scope

> "The ISMS covers the design, development, and delivery of cloud-based financial services, including all supporting IT infrastructure, personnel, and processes at the London headquarters and Dublin data center. Excludes: marketing systems and physical retail locations."

### Common Scope Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| **Too broad** | Unmanageable, resource-intensive |
| **Too narrow** | Critical assets excluded, false sense of security |
| **Unclear boundaries** | Confusion about what's covered |
| **Missing interfaces** | Dependencies not addressed |

## The ISMS (Clause 4.4)

### Establishing the ISMS

Organizations must establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve an ISMS including:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Processes** | Activities needed to manage information security |
| **Interactions** | How processes relate to each other |
| **Inputs/Outputs** | What flows between processes |
| **Resources** | What's needed to operate processes |
| **Responsibilities** | Who is accountable |

### Process Approach

The ISMS should use a **process approach**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    ISMS PROCESSES                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                         │
│  ┌──────────┐   ┌──────────┐   ┌──────────┐           │
│  │   Risk   │──▶│  Control │──▶│ Monitor  │           │
│  │Assessment│   │Selection │   │& Measure │           │
│  └──────────┘   └──────────┘   └──────────┘           │
│       ▲                              │                 │
│       │                              │                 │
│       └──────────────────────────────┘                 │
│                  Feedback                              │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Documentation Requirements

### Mandatory Documented Information

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Scope** | Define ISMS boundaries |
| **Information security policy** | Management direction |
| **Risk assessment process** | How risks are assessed |
| **Risk treatment process** | How risks are treated |
| **Statement of Applicability** | Control decisions |
| **Risk treatment plan** | Treatment actions |
| **Objectives** | Security goals |

### Document Control

Documents must be:
- **Identified** — Title, date, version, author
- **Approved** — Authorized before use
- **Available** — Accessible to those who need them
- **Protected** — Secure from unauthorized changes
- **Controlled** — Version managed, obsolete versions removed

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Context drives the ISMS** — Understand your environment first
2. **Stakeholders matter** — Their requirements shape the system
3. **Scope must be clear** — Define boundaries precisely
4. **Document everything** — Evidence of conformity
5. **Review regularly** — Context and requirements change

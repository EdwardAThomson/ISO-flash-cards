# ISO/IEC 27001 Overview

## What is ISO 27001?

**ISO/IEC 27001** is the international standard for **Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)**. It provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive information, ensuring it remains secure through people, processes, and technology.

## Key Facts

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Full title** | ISO/IEC 27001:2022 — Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection — Information security management systems — Requirements |
| **Current version** | 2022 (replaced 2013 version) |
| **Type** | Certifiable management system standard |
| **Structure** | Clauses 4–10 (requirements) + Annex A (controls) |
| **Related standards** | ISO 27002 (control guidance), ISO 27005 (risk management) |

## Purpose

ISO 27001 helps organizations:
- **Protect information assets** from threats
- **Manage risks** systematically
- **Demonstrate compliance** to stakeholders
- **Build trust** with customers and partners
- **Meet regulatory requirements** (GDPR, etc.)

## The CIA Triad

Information security aims to protect three properties:

| Property | Definition | Example Threat |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Information accessible only to authorized parties | Data breach |
| **Integrity** | Information accurate and complete | Unauthorized modification |
| **Availability** | Information accessible when needed | System downtime |

                        └───────────┘
```

### Risk-Based Approach

ISO 27001 is fundamentally **risk-based**:
1. **Identify** information assets and their value
2. **Assess** threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts
3. **Treat** risks by selecting appropriate controls
4. **Monitor** effectiveness and adapt

---

## Key Concepts

### Information Security Policy
Top-level document establishing management's direction and commitment to information security.

### Statement of Applicability (SoA)
Document listing all Annex A controls with justification for inclusion or exclusion.

### Risk Assessment
Process to identify, analyze, and evaluate information security risks.

### Risk Treatment Plan
Document describing how identified risks will be addressed.

### Controls
Measures that modify risk — can be preventive, detective, or corrective.

## 2022 Updates

The 2022 revision brought significant changes:

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Restructured controls** | From 114 controls in 14 domains → 93 controls in 4 themes |
| **New controls** | 11 new controls added (threat intelligence, cloud security, etc.) |
| **Merged controls** | Many controls consolidated |
| **Updated terminology** | Aligned with current practices |
| **Attributes** | Controls now have attributes (control types, properties, etc.) |

### New Controls in 2022

- Threat intelligence
- Information security for cloud services
- ICT readiness for business continuity
- Physical security monitoring
- Configuration management
- Information deletion
- Data masking
- Data leakage prevention
- Monitoring activities
- Web filtering
- Secure coding

# Risk Assessment & Treatment

## Planning (Clause 6)

Clause 6 addresses how organizations plan to manage information security risks and achieve their objectives.

## Actions to Address Risks and Opportunities (Clause 6.1)

### General (6.1.1)

When planning the ISMS, organizations must consider:
- Context issues (Clause 4.1)
- Stakeholder requirements (Clause 4.2)

And determine risks and opportunities to:
- Ensure the ISMS achieves intended outcomes
- Prevent or reduce undesired effects
- Achieve continual improvement

---

## Information Security Risk Assessment (Clause 6.1.2)

Organizations must define and apply a risk assessment process.

### Risk Identification

Identify risks by considering:

| Element | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| **Assets** | Data, systems, people, facilities |
| **Threats** | Hackers, malware, natural disasters, human error |
| **Vulnerabilities** | Unpatched systems, weak passwords, lack of training |
| **Impacts** | Financial loss, reputation damage, regulatory fines |

### Risk Analysis

Assess each risk for:
- **Likelihood** — Probability of occurrence
- **Consequence** — Severity of impact

### Risk Matrix

|                    | Low Impact | Medium Impact | High Impact |
|--------------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **High Likelihood**    | Medium     | High          | Critical    |
| **Medium Likelihood**  | Low        | Medium        | High        |
| **Low Likelihood**     | Low        | Low           | Medium      |

### Risk Evaluation

- Compare risk levels against acceptance criteria
- Prioritize risks for treatment
- Identify risks requiring immediate action
- Document risk assessment results

---

## Information Security Risk Treatment (Clause 6.1.3)

### Risk Treatment Process

Organizations must define and apply a process to:

1. **Select treatment options** — Based on risk assessment
2. **Determine controls** — From Annex A or other sources
3. **Compare to Annex A** — Verify no necessary controls omitted
4. **Produce Statement of Applicability** — Document decisions
5. **Formulate treatment plan** — Actions, responsibilities, timelines
6. **Obtain approval** — Risk owners approve residual risks

### Risk Treatment Options

| Option | Description | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Modify** | Implement controls to reduce risk | Risk can be reduced cost-effectively |
| **Avoid** | Eliminate the risk source | Risk exceeds tolerance, no good controls |
| **Share** | Transfer to another party | Insurance, outsourcing |
| **Retain** | Accept the risk | Within tolerance, treatment not cost-effective |

### Control Selection

When selecting controls, consider:
- Effectiveness in reducing risk
- Cost of implementation
- Operational impact
- Regulatory requirements
- Stakeholder expectations

---

## Statement of Applicability (SoA)

The SoA is a **mandatory document** that lists:
- All Annex A controls
- Whether each is applicable
- Justification for inclusion or exclusion
- Implementation status

### SoA Template

| Control | Applicable | Justification | Status |
|---------|------------|---------------|--------|
| A.5.1 Policies | Yes | Required for governance | Implemented |
| A.5.7 Threat intelligence | Yes | Needed for risk awareness | Partial |
| A.7.4 Physical security monitoring | No | No physical premises in scope | N/A |

### SoA Best Practices

- Keep current with changes
- Link to evidence of implementation
- Review during audits
- Use as a control inventory

---

## Risk Treatment Plan

### Plan Contents

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Risks** | Which risks are being treated |
| **Controls** | What controls will be implemented |
| **Actions** | Specific implementation steps |
| **Resources** | Budget, people, tools needed |
| **Responsibilities** | Who is accountable |
| **Timelines** | When actions will be completed |
| **Metrics** | How success will be measured |

### Residual Risk

After treatment, **residual risk** remains. Risk owners must:
- Understand the residual risk
- Formally accept it
- Document the acceptance

---

## Information Security Objectives (Clause 6.2)

### Objective Requirements

Organizations must establish objectives that are:
- **Consistent** with the information security policy
- **Measurable** (if practicable)
- **Monitored** and updated
- **Communicated** to relevant parties
- **Documented**

### Planning to Achieve Objectives (Clause 6.3)

For each objective, determine:
- **What** will be done
- **Resources** needed
- **Responsibility** for completion
- **Timeline** for completion
- **Evaluation** method

### Example Objectives

| Objective | Measure | Target |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Reduce phishing success | Click rate on simulations | < 5% |
| Improve patch compliance | % systems patched within SLA | > 95% |
| Increase awareness | Training completion rate | 100% |
| Reduce incidents | Security incidents per quarter | < 10 |

---

## Annex A: Risk-Related Controls

### A.5.7 Threat Intelligence

**Control:** Information about threats shall be collected and analyzed.

### A.5.23 Information Security for Cloud Services

**Control:** Processes for acquisition, use, management, and exit from cloud services shall be established.

### A.5.29 Information Security During Disruption

**Control:** Plans shall be prepared to maintain security during disruption.

### A.5.30 ICT Readiness for Business Continuity

**Control:** ICT readiness shall be planned, implemented, maintained, and tested.

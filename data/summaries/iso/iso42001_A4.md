# A4: Risk & Impact Management

## Planning (Clause 6)

Planning in ISO 42001 focuses on addressing **risks and opportunities**, establishing **AI objectives**, and planning **actions** to achieve them.

## Addressing Risks and Opportunities (Clause 6.1)

### General Requirements (6.1.1)

When planning the AIMS, organizations must consider:
- Context issues (Clause 4.1)
- Stakeholder requirements (Clause 4.2)

And determine risks and opportunities to:
- Ensure the AIMS achieves intended outcomes
- Prevent or reduce undesired effects
- Achieve continual improvement

### AI Risk Assessment (6.1.2)

Organizations must define and apply an **AI risk assessment process** that:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Establishes criteria** | Risk acceptance criteria and assessment criteria |
| **Ensures consistency** | Repeated assessments produce consistent results |
| **Identifies risks** | Risks associated with AI system lifecycle |
| **Analyzes risks** | Assess consequences and likelihood |
| **Evaluates risks** | Compare against criteria, prioritize treatment |

### AI System Impact Assessment (6.1.3)

Organizations must assess the **potential consequences** of AI systems on:

| Impact Area | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Individuals** | Privacy, autonomy, safety, fairness |
| **Groups** | Discrimination, social cohesion |
| **Organizations** | Reputation, liability, operations |
| **Society** | Employment, democracy, environment |

The impact assessment must consider:
- Intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse
- The AI system lifecycle stages
- Affected individuals and groups
- Potential positive and negative impacts

### AI Risk Treatment (6.1.4)

Organizations must define and apply a process to:

1. **Select treatment options** — Considering risk assessment results
2. **Determine controls** — From Annex A or other sources
3. **Produce Statement of Applicability** — Document control decisions
4. **Formulate treatment plan** — Actions, responsibilities, timelines
5. **Obtain approval** — Risk owners approve residual risks

### Treatment Options

| Option | Description | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Avoid** | Eliminate the risk source | Risk exceeds tolerance |
| **Modify** | Change likelihood or consequence | Risk can be reduced |
| **Share** | Transfer to another party | Insurance, contracts |
| **Retain** | Accept the risk | Within tolerance |

## AI Objectives (Clause 6.2)

### Setting Objectives

Organizations must establish **AI objectives** at relevant functions and levels.

Objectives must be:
- **Consistent** with the AI policy
- **Measurable** (if practicable)
- **Monitored** and updated as needed
- **Communicated** to relevant parties
- **Documented** and maintained

### Planning to Achieve Objectives (6.3)

For each objective, determine:

| Element | Questions to Answer |
|---------|---------------------|
| **What** | What will be done? |
| **Resources** | What resources are needed? |
| **Responsibility** | Who is responsible? |
| **Timeline** | When will it be completed? |
| **Evaluation** | How will results be evaluated? |

## Annex A Controls: Assessing Impacts (A.5)

### A.5.2 AI System Impact Assessment Process

**Control:** A process for assessing the impacts of AI systems shall be established.

**Implementation guidance:**
- Define assessment methodology
- Identify assessment triggers (new systems, changes, incidents)
- Specify who conducts assessments
- Document assessment outcomes

### A.5.3 Documenting AI System Impact Assessment

**Control:** AI system impact assessments shall be documented.

**Required documentation:**
- Assessment scope and methodology
- Identified impacts (positive and negative)
- Affected parties
- Likelihood and severity
- Mitigation measures
- Residual impacts

### A.5.4 Ongoing Assessment

**Control:** AI system impacts shall be assessed on an ongoing basis.

**Triggers for reassessment:**
- Significant changes to AI system
- Changes in deployment context
- New information about impacts
- Incidents or complaints
- Regulatory changes

### A.5.5 Intended Use Documentation

**Control:** The intended use of AI systems shall be documented.

**Documentation should include:**
- Purpose and objectives
- Target users
- Operational environment
- Intended inputs and outputs
- Known limitations
- Out-of-scope uses

## Risk Assessment Process

### Step 1: Establish Context

- Define assessment scope
- Identify stakeholders
- Determine risk criteria
- Set risk tolerance levels

### Step 2: Risk Identification

Identify risks related to:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Technical** | Model failures, data quality, security vulnerabilities |
| **Operational** | Misuse, over-reliance, integration issues |
| **Compliance** | Regulatory violations, contractual breaches |
| **Reputational** | Public perception, trust erosion |
| **Ethical** | Bias, fairness, transparency issues |

### Step 3: Risk Analysis

For each risk, assess:
- **Likelihood** — Probability of occurrence
- **Consequence** — Severity of impact
- **Risk level** — Combination of likelihood and consequence

### Risk Matrix Example

|              | Low Impact | Medium Impact | High Impact |
|--------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **High Likelihood** | Medium | High | Critical |
| **Medium Likelihood** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Low Likelihood** | Low | Low | Medium |

### Step 4: Risk Evaluation

- Compare risks against acceptance criteria
- Prioritize risks for treatment
- Identify risks requiring immediate action

### Step 5: Risk Treatment

- Select appropriate treatment options
- Implement controls
- Document residual risk
- Obtain risk owner approval

## Statement of Applicability (SoA)

The SoA documents:
- Controls selected from Annex A
- Justification for inclusion
- Implementation status
- Justification for any exclusions

### SoA Template

| Control | Applicable | Justification | Status |
|---------|------------|---------------|--------|
| A.5.2 Impact Assessment Process | Yes | Required for all AI systems | Implemented |
| A.6.2.4 Design Documentation | Yes | Development activities in scope | Partial |
| A.9.4 User Documentation | No | No external users | N/A |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Risk-based approach** — Focus resources on highest risks
2. **Impact assessment** — Consider effects on individuals and society
3. **Documented process** — Consistent, repeatable assessments
4. **Treatment planning** — Clear actions, responsibilities, timelines
5. **Statement of Applicability** — Transparent control decisions
6. **Ongoing assessment** — Risks change over time

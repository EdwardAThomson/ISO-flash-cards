# Access Control & Identity

## Access Control Principles

Access control ensures that only **authorized users** can access information and systems, and only to the extent necessary for their role.

## Annex A: Access Control (A.5.15–A.5.18)

### A.5.15 Access Control

**Control:** Rules to control physical and logical access shall be established based on business and security requirements.

### Access Control Policy

Should address:
- Access control principles (need-to-know, least privilege)
- Authorization process
- Access review requirements
- Segregation of duties
- Emergency access procedures

### A.5.16 Identity Management

**Control:** The full lifecycle of identities shall be managed.

### Identity Lifecycle

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              IDENTITY LIFECYCLE                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│  - Provisioning  - Role changes  - Termination        │
│  - Verification  - Access review - Suspension         │
│  - Unique ID     - Re-certification - Deletion        │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### A.5.17 Authentication Information

**Control:** Allocation and management of authentication information shall be controlled.

**Authentication factors:**

| Factor | Type | Examples |
|--------|------|----------|
| **Something you know** | Knowledge | Password, PIN |
| **Something you have** | Possession | Token, smart card, phone |
| **Something you are** | Inherence | Fingerprint, face, iris |

**Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Combining two or more factors.

### A.5.18 Access Rights

**Control:** Access rights shall be provisioned, reviewed, modified, and removed.

**Access rights management:**
- Provision based on role and need
- Review periodically (recertification)
- Modify when roles change
- Remove promptly on termination

---

## Annex A: Technological Controls - Access (A.8.2–A.8.5)

### A.8.2 Privileged Access Rights

**Control:** Privileged access rights shall be restricted and managed.

**Privileged accounts include:**
- System administrators
- Database administrators
- Network administrators
- Security administrators
- Service accounts

**Controls for privileged access:**
- Separate privileged accounts from regular accounts
- Just-in-time access
- Privileged access workstations
- Enhanced monitoring
- Regular review

### A.8.3 Information Access Restriction

**Control:** Access to information shall be restricted according to policy.

**Implementation:**
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Access control lists (ACLs)
- Data classification enforcement

### A.8.4 Access to Source Code

**Control:** Access to source code and development tools shall be managed.

**Protect:**
- Source code repositories
- Development environments
- Build systems
- Configuration files

### A.8.5 Secure Authentication

**Control:** Secure authentication technologies shall be implemented.

**Requirements:**
- Strong password policies
- Account lockout
- Session management
- Secure credential storage
- Protection against brute force

## Password Management

### Password Policy Elements

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Length** | Minimum 12-14 characters |
| **Complexity** | Mix of character types (or passphrase) |
| **History** | Prevent reuse of recent passwords |
| **Expiry** | Consider risk-based approach vs. fixed expiry |
| **Lockout** | After failed attempts |
| **Storage** | Hashed with strong algorithm |

### Modern Approaches

- **Passphrases** — Longer, easier to remember
- **Password managers** — Unique passwords per system
- **Passwordless** — FIDO2, biometrics
- **Risk-based authentication** — Adaptive based on context

## Key Takeaways

1. **Least privilege** — Only access needed for the role
2. **Identity lifecycle** — Manage from creation to deletion
3. **MFA is essential** — Multiple factors reduce risk
4. **Privileged access** — Extra controls for admin accounts
5. **Physical security** — Protect the physical environment
6. **Clear desk/screen** — Simple but effective controls

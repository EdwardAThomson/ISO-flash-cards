# A1: Scope & AIMS Basics

## What is an AI Management System (AIMS)?

An **Artificial Intelligence Management System (AIMS)** is a set of interrelated elements that organizations use to establish policies, objectives, and processes to achieve responsible AI development and use.

## Purpose of ISO 42001

ISO/IEC 42001 specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an AIMS. It enables organizations to:

- Provide AI systems that meet stakeholder needs
- Manage risks and opportunities related to AI
- Conform to AI policies and applicable requirements
- Demonstrate responsible AI practices

## Scope Considerations

### Determining AIMS Scope

Organizations must define the **boundaries and applicability** of their AIMS:

| Factor | Considerations |
|--------|----------------|
| **External issues** | Regulatory environment, market expectations, technology trends |
| **Internal issues** | Organizational culture, capabilities, strategic direction |
| **Interested parties** | Customers, regulators, employees, affected communities |
| **AI systems** | Which systems are included in the AIMS |

### Scope Statement

The scope must be documented and include:
- The AI systems covered
- Organizational units involved
- Locations where AI activities occur
- Interfaces with external parties

## The Harmonized Structure

ISO 42001 follows the **ISO Harmonized Structure (Annex SL)**, making it compatible with other management system standards:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│   PLAN: Clauses 4, 5, 6, 7             │
│   - Context, Leadership, Planning       │
│   - Support and Resources               │
│                                         │
│   DO: Clause 8                          │
│   - Operation and Implementation        │
│                                         │
│   CHECK: Clause 9                       │
│   - Performance Evaluation              │
│   - Monitoring, Audit, Review           │
│                                         │
│   ACT: Clause 10                        │
│   - Improvement                         │
│   - Corrective Actions                  │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Key Definitions

### AI System
A machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers from input how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments.

### AI System Lifecycle
The phases of an AI system from inception through retirement:
1. Design and development
2. Verification and validation
3. Deployment
4. Operation and monitoring
5. Retirement

### Interested Party (Stakeholder)
Person or organization that can affect, be affected by, or perceive themselves to be affected by a decision or activity related to AI systems.

### Risk
Effect of uncertainty on objectives — can be positive (opportunity) or negative (threat).

### Impact
The effect that an AI system has on an individual, group, community, or environment.

## Normative References

ISO 42001 references:
- **ISO/IEC 22989** — AI concepts and terminology
- **ISO/IEC 23894** — AI risk management guidance

## Integration with Other Standards

| Standard | Integration Point |
|----------|-------------------|
| **ISO 27001** | Information security controls for AI data and models |
| **ISO 9001** | Quality management for AI development processes |
| **ISO 14001** | Environmental considerations of AI systems |
| **ISO 31000** | Risk management framework alignment |

## Documentation Requirements

The AIMS must include:

### Mandatory Documents
- Scope of the AIMS
- AI policy
- AI objectives
- Risk assessment results
- Statement of Applicability
- Documented procedures (as required)

### Mandatory Records
- Evidence of competence
- Monitoring and measurement results
- Internal audit results
- Management review outputs
- Nonconformities and corrective actions

## Key Takeaways

1. **Scope definition** is foundational — clearly define what's included
2. **PDCA cycle** drives continuous improvement
3. **Integration** with existing management systems is encouraged
4. **Documentation** provides evidence of conformity
5. **Flexibility** — requirements can be scaled to organization size and AI complexity

- Data availability and quality
- Technical complexity
- Resource requirements
- Potential negative impacts

### A.6.2.4 Design Documentation

**Control:** Design and development shall be documented.

**Documentation includes:**
- System architecture
- Component specifications
- Interface definitions

- Assumptions and constraints

---

## Development Phase

### A.6.2.5 Verification and Validation

**Control:** AI systems shall be verified and validated.

| Activity | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| **Verification** | "Did we build it right?" — System meets specifications |
| **Validation** | "Did we build the right thing?" — System meets user needs |

### A.6.2.6 Testing

**Control:** AI systems shall be tested.

**Testing strategy:**

| Test Level | Scope |
|------------|-------|
| **Unit testing** | Individual components |
| **Integration testing** | Component interactions |
| **System testing** | Complete system |
| **Acceptance testing** | User requirements |

**AI-specific testing:**
- Performance on diverse data
- Fairness across groups
- Robustness to variations
- Behavior at boundaries
- Adversarial inputs

---

## Deployment Phase

### A.6.2.7 Deployment

**Control:** Deployment of AI systems shall be managed.

**Deployment activities:**

| Activity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Planning** | Define deployment approach, timeline, rollback |
| **Configuration** | Set up production environment |
| **Integration** | Connect with other systems |
| **Training** | Prepare users and operators |
| **Communication** | Inform stakeholders |
| **Monitoring setup** | Establish monitoring capabilities |

### Deployment Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Big bang** | Full deployment at once | Low-risk systems |
| **Phased** | Gradual rollout by region/user group | Moderate risk |
| **Canary** | Small subset first, then expand | Higher risk |
| **Shadow** | Run alongside existing system | Critical systems |

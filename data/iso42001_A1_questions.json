      "Because scope statements are required only for marketing purposes.",
      "To avoid the need for documenting any supporting processes.",

      "It removes the need to involve top management in AI decisions.",
      "A formal AIMS provides structured processes, responsibilities, and continual improvement, reducing reliance on ad-hoc decisions.",

      "Immediately start decommissioning any AI system that looks risky.",

      "Agree to exclude the new feature from the AIMS so it can launch faster.",
